Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
  During the development of the full stack project, various front-end code types were utilized across different parts of the application. The customer-facing site was initially created in Express HTML but was later switched to a .hbs view to enhance rendering speeds, allowing for faster loading by avoiding the need to load every component of the site upon each refresh. Unlike HTML, which is static and client-facing, and therefore cannot interact with backend databases to dynamically update information, JavaScript serves as a front-end and back-end coding language that adds dynamic elements to webpages. In this project, JavaScript was employed to retrieve trip information from the MongoDB database, enabling the page to change dynamically based on user interactions. A single-page application (SPA) is a type of website that does not fully refresh the page based on user interactions, similar to how an HTML page would behave. This feature is particularly beneficial as it gives the website a local/native application feel when users interact with it.


Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  The backend opted for a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility in modifying schema to accommodate scaling and functionality changes swiftly. Additionally, its non-relational nature allows for rapid horizontal scaling, making it a preferred choice for the project's requirements.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
  JSON serves as a standardized format for organizing object data, which can be readily interpreted by JavaScript to create literal JavaScript objects. This streamlined process facilitates JavaScript's ability to transform the data into JavaScript objects effortlessly, effectively bridging frontend and backend development. By providing a means for storing data or JavaScript objects on the backend and utilizing them based on frontend requests, JSON facilitates seamless integration between the two layers of development. Moreover, this approach enables data to be stored once and accessed in multiple contexts, enhancing efficiency and versatility in application development.


Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  The code underwent refactoring to enhance functionality and efficiency, specifically concerning the trip card and trip list components. Originally, having two separate components rendering identical information proved inefficient. However, restructuring the system to render each trip separately while remaining part of the cohesive whole improved the overall site functionality. Utilizing reusable UI components offers numerous benefits: it reduces the application's overall size, accelerates the development process, and minimizes the likelihood of errors and vulnerabilities being introduced into the system, assuming the components themselves are secure.


Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
  Prior to implementing security measures, there are several methods for testing endpoints. Initially, one can directly access the localhost web address associated with the API endpoint to ascertain whether the page successfully loads the data or to identify any errors encountered during the process. Alternatively, utilizing an application such as Postman, designed for testing HTTP requests, proves beneficial. Postman not only facilitates endpoint testing but also allows for the incorporation of security measures and inputs, enabling the evaluation of endpoints that may be safeguarded against unauthorized access.
  In a full stack application, the functionality and dynamics of a webpage are primarily driven by the methods employed. HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE play a crucial role in retrieving or modifying the database to implement various functionalities. On the backend, these requests are handled using database functions like .create, .findOne, .find, and .findOneAndUpdate, which modify the database according to the client's requirements. The outcomes of these methods are reflected in endpoints, which are observed by both the admin and client sides of the application. It's essential to thoroughly test endpoints to ensure they operate as intended, displaying data accurately or indicating errors when necessary.
  Additionally, security measures are crucial to prevent unauthorized or unauthenticated users from accessing or modifying the database. For instance, when adding or editing a trip in the database, API endpoints must be protected to prevent unauthorized tampering. Implementing security measures adds another layer of code aimed at safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of the data within the application.
